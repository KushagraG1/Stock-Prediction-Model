# Approach

• Adopted the LSTM model, a powerful RNN to capture and learn complex temporal dependencies in stock data

• Trained model using comprehensive historical stock info. dataset, ensuring thorough analysis of trends & patterns

• Implemented advanced data preprocessing techniques, including normalisation, scaling, and handling missing values
through interpolation & feature engineering to optimise the model’s performance and enhance prediction accuracy

# Outcome
